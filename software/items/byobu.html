			<p>Byobu might be one of the most important utilities I use (along with OpenSSH and Vim) it's extremely useful for when you have to do 2 things at the same time, most built-in tab support in terminals are annoying and they plainly suck, byobu introduces an easy way to create new tabs and browse back and forth between existing ones, F2 to create a new tab, F3 to go back to the previous window, F4 to go to the next window. I don't configure byobu because I like it the way it is, but you might want to experiment with some additional configuration, maybe try changing the status bar. And you can do that by pressing F9 and selecting Toggle Status Bar Notifications.</p>
