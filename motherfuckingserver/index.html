		<h1>This is a motherfucking server</h1>
		<p>And it's fucking perfect.</p>
		<h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
		<p>You are probably a system admin. You think your unencrypted, uncompressed garbage is going to get you some fucking Award. Your think your tor-blocking no-security-headers website is giving The NSA a boner because they can finally spy on people. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass server.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Shit's compressed</li>
			<li>Shit's encrypted</li>
			<li>Shit's open-secure</li>
			<li>The NSA can't fucking spy on your visitors</li>
			<li>Your shit doesn't contain Analytics or any bullshit.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
		<p>You. Are. A piece of shit. Look at your shitty server. it's a motherfucking server running an outdated version of shitty Windows 10, hosting a shitty website using outdated HTTP garbage that contains shitty slow proprietary Google Analytics code and other dumb fucking bullshit and it's not even fucking compressed.</p>
		<p>Why the fuck would you need to know the exact location of every shitty user that looks at your shitty website you dumb fuck, and why the fuck aren't you using HTTPS? My god damn Thinkpad R500 can encrypt this shit, if it can then your shitty server can too! As a matter of fact, why the fuck are you trying to help the NSA? You already paid them with your tax dollars! Encrypt your shit!</p>
		<p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect server. Here's why:</p>
		<h2>It's fucking encrypted</h2>
		<p>This server is encrypting everything that goes between it, that's good, it prevents greedy and shitty ISPs from knowing exactly what users are looking that, it prevents hackers from knowing your user's shitty passwords, (if you have a login form you absolutely need encryption.) Your shitty bank uses it, Your shitty search engine uses it, Your shitty government uses it. SO WHY THE FUCK SHOULDN'T YOU MOTHERFUCKER?</p>
		<h2>It's fucking compressed</h2>
		<p>Let me remind you why the fuck you should enable compression on your shitty server, it's fast as fuck, it saves time for your users (Especially if you're loading all of that Analytics and JQuery bullshit from Google) most devices can compress this shitty webpage in a single second, you have no excuse but laziness. Use better technology jackass</p>
		<h2>It's fucking open source</h2>
		<p>You think Windows Server is a good OS for webservers? You're a fucking joke, leave the server industry forever you fool, Linux is open-source, and if you don't understand what the fuck that means, it means YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT WITH IT! The NSA isn't gonna thank you because you're using Windows, they won't get a boner from your generousity, let me repeat what I said previously, You are already paying them with your tax dollars and privacy, so stop fucking helping them and use Linux or other open-source shit.</p>
		</p>
		<h2>It's bullshit-free</h2>
		<p>This server barely loads any bullshit, the only thing it loads is a 10 Kilobyte CSS script, no javascript and no bullshit. Meanwhile, your shitty server loads 10 different Analytics programs, 15 Like buttons, 57 JavaScript scripts from external websites and 135 Fonts. if you want to know why that's bad (you dumb piece of shit) then visit <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">this website instead.</a></p>
		<h2>It's fucking secure</h2>
		<p>Unlike your shitty outdated Windows Server, this server runs on Linux, and is up to date! All bugs and security vulnerabilities are fixed in a fucking flash meanwhile your server is still sucking on The NSA's cock.</p>
		<h2>This is a server, Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
		<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty outdated unencrypted uncompressed no-security-headers proprietary Windows bastardization of what should be encrypted, compressed, secure and open-source text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, secure server. Look at it. it's fucking beautiful.</p>
		<h2>No this is not fucking satire</h2>
		<p>Ehh... Kinda. Your shitty server should do these things but things will change in the future, what I am saying is stop relying on outdated bullshit and use stable, secure and powerful technologies you god damn primate.</p>
		<aside>"Your shitty server could be better.</aside>
