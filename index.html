	<h2>Nginx doesn't work...</h2>
	<p>Date: Sep-03-2021</p>
	<p>For some reason, Nginx refuses to work. And I am too tired to fix it anymore, I will use Github Pages for a while.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="post">
	<h2>Server update</h2>
	<p>Date: Aug-12-2021</p>
	<p>I switched from Apache to Nginx, and I also setup a cgit instance at <a href="https://git.oklomsy.com">git.oklomsy.com</a></p>

	<h2>Small outage!</h2>
	<p>Date: Jul-26-2021</p>
	<p>The server was down for a day, we had forgot to pay our bills... we paid the bills and we got our internet back, I am sorry for the outage. I hope that this doesn't happen again!

	<h2>Quick update</h2>
	<p>Date: Jun-13-2021</p>
	<p>I dont have any ideas for blog content yet, I already wrote 5 blog posts but I have decided not to publish them, they are public however, if you know the URL.
	<br>I will make a list of blog content that I haven't posted yet and my reason for why I didn't post it:
	<ul>
		<li>"Why I don't use Cloudflare"</li>
		<p>in that blog post, I went on about how Cloudflare isn't good for your privacy, it is finished but I have decided not to publish it because I do use Cloudflare, I use Cloudflare's DNS because their DNS service has way more types of DNS records than my domain registrar's DNS, I also use DNSSEC and I had to switch to Cloudflare for it to work properly. but I do not use Cloudflare's reverse proxy because it blocks Tor users and it also doesn't respect people's privacy</p>
		<li>"Reasons why you shouldn't use Discord"</li>
		<p>I was mainly talking about how Discord (obviously) doesn't respect your privacy, how it uses Google Cloud so your messages can also be read by Google, Discordgg.ga, and also how they terminate tons of accounts for no reason at all... The reason why I did not publish it was because I use Discord to communicate and I would look like a hypocrite if I published it but again, you can read it if you know the URL.</p>
		<li>"My experience with Minimalism"</li>
		<p>I like this article, it contains how much I had to struggle with switching to minimalist desktops while making myself more independent, the problem is: it's old, 2 weeks ago I tried to install a lightweight desktop (Xfce4 panel + Openbox + Nitrogen + Xfce4 utilities and goodies) and i had much better luck, I also installed KeepassXC and found that way easier to use than Bitwarden or Lockwise. So I have to update it before I publish it which is not my priority now.</p>
		<li>"Privacy practices I follow"</li>
		<p>This article outlines the privacy practices that I follow, but its old and i haven't bothered updating it, and I am also afraid that I will be looked down upon if I publish this, I am afraid that no one will trust communicating with me if I publish this. I do follow obvious privacy practices but not that much anymore I need to work more on my privacy practices and I have to update this before publishing it</p>
	</ul>
	<p>These are ALL of the blog posts I haven't published, I will write more soon or publish these ones hopefully.</p>

	<h2>I am proud of my achievements so far</h2>
	<p>Date: May-20-2021</p>
	<p>If you told me one year ago that I would be "creating a home server with full-disk encryption, passwordless SSH keys and 2 Factor Authentication while hosting an Email server using Postfix, Dovecot with SPF,DKIM,DMARC and a CalDAV and a CardDAV server using Radicale I would think you're insane, its crazy how I have achieved these things. I am so proud of them, it seems as if every day is a step towards even more privacy.
	<br>I never thought I would see myself doing this type of thing but its fun, I still have a lot of work to do but now I can relax and just appreciate my home server
	<br>Thanks to everyone, My family, Friends and especially <a href="https://sparksammy.com">Sparksammy</a> for introducing me to Linux and GNU.
	<br>I am not sure where I would be without you all. But I definitely wouldn't be hosting an email server.

	<h2>Server reinstalled again</h2>
	<p>Date: May-17-2021</p>
	<p>I had to reinstall everything, yesterday I tried running "Chmod 750 * -R" on my home directory, but my home directory had a couple of symlinks, one to the root directory (Cause I was using Ubuntu File Manager for managing files on the server sometimes) and the other to /var/www for apache. My system was basically unusable at this point so I had no choice but to reinstall...</p>

	<div class="post">
	<h2>May Update</h2>
	<p>Date: May-3-2021</p>
	<p>This is just another update since I haven't posted very much in my blog, twitter or this news bar, just letting you all know I still haven't been killed from a joint operation by the Danish Intelligence Agency and the CIA.
	<br><br>and let's hope it stays that way
	<br><br>I honestly don't have any ideas for blog posts, its been 4 months since I have published a blog posts and I don't post on Twitter a lot.</p>

	<h2>GPG Keys</h2>
	<p>Date: Apr-17-2021</p>
	<p>I now have a webpage dedicated to my PGP keys. So now you can see what keys I currently use and which ones are revoked, I also upload my key to the MIT keyserver and the Ubuntu Keyserver and I also have my key uploaded in the openpgp keyserver where I verified my email and my identity</p>
	<p>I forgot to update my key unfortunately, but I didn't receive any email during that time so its okay, the latest key is available <a href="/mainpublic.asc">here</a></p>

            <p>Date: Feb-16-2021</p>
            <p>Hello! I got a new site design! This site design is a combination of two previous website designs, it took more than 2 months to develop each one individually, and almost a year for me to FINALLY MAKE A NEW SITE! The old stuff has been deleted,
                I don't want it to haunt me anymore. I have backed up the old site, but it is mostly gone!
