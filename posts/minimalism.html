	<h2 id="1">Events leading up to installing a minimal desktop</h2>
		About a week ago, Sam said he partially quit Discord due
		to it collecting data (He already knew about this though)
		and he switched to Element/Matrix, I was proud of the change
		and he also got a laptop with Linux, and started looking into
		"minimalism", His laptop was apparently so slow that he 
		needed a minimal desktop. I didn't really mind, but he started
		preaching about how minimal his desktop was, and I was curious
		about it, He had switched to a Desktop environment with
		Openbox, Lxpanel and Nitrogen.
		<br><br>He also changed browsing habits among other things,
		he changed from mozilla to surf. and I never understood why
		he said it was because "Mozilla no longer supports a free web"
		and he linked to a Odyssey video complaining about a Mozilla
		blog post. The blog post said that we need more than deplatforming
		, in response to the capitol riots. First off, I viewed this as
		a warning sign and I tried to switch to other products, I 
		really tried. 
		<h2 id="2">Encryption Limits!</h2>
		I really wanted to switch  to a different browser but I need
		Lockwise, I need a password manager and I would have chosen Bitwarden
		but there is a stupid feature they added called a "Encrypted password character
		limit". If your password (when encrypted) is more than a 1000 
		characters long then you cannot import it despite there being no reason why.
		Lastpass could import it, Lockwise can 100% import it, Every other
		Password manager can import it but why can't Bitwarden?
		<br><br>I needed answers as to why this feature even exists?
		so I looked online and a person said it was a anti-abuse feature?
		How? How is it being abused? what's wrong with having a long password?
		There were more questions than answers and it was about to get worse.
		when someone asked for help with dealing on this issue, the same person
		said that passwords longer than 124 are useless and provided NO INFORMATION
		on the feature.
		<br><br>they provided information about why passwords longer than
		124 characters were useless but NOTHING ELSE. This is a huge "F you" to
		people who don't know better, all he did was say "Shouldn't have used a
		a password longer than 124 characters!" and it pissed me off!
		I tried to switch to a FOSS alternative, but I was betrayed!
		So in the end, I had to switch to Lockwise, and I didn't trust
		Lastpass either, they seemed to care more about convenience and
		less about privacy.
		<br><br>But whatever, Firefox can just stay in my system.
		it's already faster than Surf (typing on certain websites
		is faster in Firefox than in Surf) and Surf is just more useless
		It's minimal for sure, but it's like someone developed a web browser
		in 2001 for a 2019 Linux desktop.
		We take all of our modern devices and apps for granted, but someone
		had to develop this, they had to think "This is a good idea!" to develop it
		They spent skill, time and effort on this so users like Sam can surf "faster"
		(Typing on certain websites in Surf is slower than in Firefox)
		But whatever, if it is faster than Firefox then I am wrong and it
		was a good idea.
		<br><br>So In the end, I still stuck with Firefox.
		because of bitwarden's encrypted password limit, I do like
		the interface of Surf, It's nice, I recommend you try it out!
		Just remember Control + G to go to a new website, actually,
		just ask <a href="https://sparksammy.com">Sam</a> about surf,
		he has a <a href="https://sparksammy.com/homepage/">useful website
		</a> about surf, you can set it to the default page surf opens!
		<h2 id="3">Installation</h2>
		I used my laptop for a server a while ago, so it
		had ubuntu server on it and it was encrypted but
		I wanted to start with a new OS. I struggled
		getting the right ubuntu flavor, I wanted
		a already working minimal desktop with full
		disk encryption but I couldn't use Lubuntu
		because it doesn't have disk encryption.
		<br><br>and then after that, I just installed the .
		components using apt. I had a working minimal desktop with
		openbox, lxpanel and nitrogen. What could
		go wrong? At first, it appeared fine.
		customizing was simple but dark mode
		for some reason didn't work in Xfce or
		Openbox...  And the brightness changer didn't
		work so I instead used Xfce4-panel instead of
		lxpanel, I just added it to the Openbox autostart
		file. Openbox and Xfce4-panel were working fine now
		but my laptop for some reason, can't go very dark.
		<br><br>
		<h2 id="4">Update</h2>
		this is future oklomsy, I switched to a
		99.4% Debian installation with Xfce4. I didn't
		have to suffer to make computing faster for me
		it was already pretty fast after all...
