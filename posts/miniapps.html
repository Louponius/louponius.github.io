		<h1>My Minimalist Adventure</h1>
		<p>Date: Aug-17-2021.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>I have tried for so long to get a minimalist Linux installation, to the point where I am now learning how to use Gentoo and how to use suckless.org software</p>
		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<p>My main portable computing device is my Thinkpad R500, I love it but it is very slow, I installed Ubuntu Desktop on it and it didn't work, The GNOME animations were too bloated, I installed Xubuntu and it worked very fine, I proceeded to use Debian Xfce4 or Xubuntu for a very long time before finally deciding on a custom Openbox + Nitrogen + Tint2 desktop, which worked for a while untill I reinstalled Debian Xfce4 because I finally had school again and I didn't want a slightly buggy desktop.</p>
		<h3>New experiments</h3>
		<p>I am trying out Gentoo, someone has said that manually compiling your kernel and removing things that it doesn't need might help, It might. I am also trying to replace every single thing I can, I might try out sbase or something else. I just want something that doesn't suck.</p>
