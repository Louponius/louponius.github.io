<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>A website in a lightweight desktop environment</h2>
<p>This website was made in Sublime, Sublime is a lightweight integrated developing environment, which is why I chose it for SMD (Sam's Minimal Desktop) combination, this integrates nicely into lxpanel and openbox which is good for me and my laptop, ever since I used this SMD, my laptop has been running faster because it doesn't waste resources on XFCE.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion: its not hard to switch to a minimal desktop and people should do it more often</strong>
</p>
<h2>Problems and adapting to a minimal desktop</h2>
<p>
However I have noticed a slight problem after using Sublime text, It selects text when I accidentally touch my mousepad (or whatever it is called) and it might delete a lot of important text that I have just spent 5 minutes writing, I also need to switch to a Dvorak Layout or change my typing habits to limit Repititive Strain Injuries.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion: its hard to adapt to a minimal desktop environment but it takes time and people should also try to limit repititive strain injuries by using a dvorak layout or changing typing/keyboard habits or just by not using the computer a lot.</strong></p>
<p>But most important of all, <strong><i>Take care of yourself, a happy body is a happy soul</i></strong></p>
<p>Especially because when it comes to Linux, because everything <b><mark>can go downhill really quick</mark></b></p>
<p>(Update from future me: This was written in Sublime Text but I instantly uninstalled it after learning it was proprietary)</p>
