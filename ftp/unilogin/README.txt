Research on Unilogin integration


UniLogin Integration Test (Also known as ULIT, ULIS and UniLogin Integration System)
is a way to integrate Unilogin into one's website without the need to contact STIL
or be a danish company, ULIT uses workarounds to implement Unilogin, these workarounds
might be unsafe or even expose dangerous user information. So Enterprise Use is 
NOT recommended, plus these workarounds are strictly proprietary and might not work
for every browser, ULIT can be anything, as long as it implements Unilogin in a safe
and secure way without the need to be a danish company.


Unilogin Introduction

  :-: Translated from the website:

"Unilogin is a web-based digital ID for students, parents and employees working in institutions.
Unilogin gives you access to national services and a wide range of educational services for e-
xample, Teaching aids"

  :-: Further clarification:

"Teaching aids" means "l√¶remidler", it basically means a service that helps you learn.
I did not know the english word for it so I put it in Google Translate and I got "Teaching aids"

By national services, STIL means "National tests and exams"

Parents can monitor student's progress and get access to discussions and announcements 
in websites such as Aula.

Students ALWAYS have a Unilogin if they are enrolled in a "primary school" (grundskole)
even if the school uses its own local login system.


  :-: From my knowledge:

Unilogin is proprietary and requires you to be a registered danish company, 

Unilogin is provided by a danish government agency called STIL,
