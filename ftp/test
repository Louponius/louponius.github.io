Evil plans:
-Install NodeJS
-Install a cryptominer on Oklomsy.com
-Install a Gemini server on Oklomsys site.
-Just kidding!
   -That being said, I kinda wish I could run my Minecraft servers here (on a different port) and run a NodeJS site.
   -However, Oklomsy thinks its bloat, which I understand.
   
Oh no!
These are evil! it would be a shame if I noticed them!
I noticed them!


Also sam what the fuck is Gemini?
PS: You can run a NodeJS site and I change redir.js for you
