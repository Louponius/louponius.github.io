Yes, I did use code snippets programmed by other people.
but there is no way I would have figured this out myself.

First off, to run this you need express and basic node libraries.
and you also need to download fortune-mod (sudo apt install fortune-mod)
Any modern version of node should work... hopefully...

1. We start by requiring express
and then we store everything we use.

you can change the port variable to change the port that express runs on.
the html var is where the site code is stored.

you can also change the fortunecmd variable to change the command ran.
You can change it to any command you want, but it is "fortune" by default.

then this is where it gets complicated.
First off, After you load a webpage, you cannot edit it.
You cannot reload or change anything in a webpage after you run res.send in express.

I wanted a button that displays a new fortune every time someone hits it.
but that isn't possible without using client-side js

So there is a script tag that has a function called "get"
the get command copies text from /fortune and puts it inside of a <p> tag with the id "furt"

and then there is a function called "run" I don't know how it works.
I tried using the "exec" function provided by child_process but it NEVER worked.
it just wouldn't display the text, so I searched online and found this snippet of code that
requires the "spawn" function from the child_process library.
I don't know how it works, feel free to study it yourself.

all i know is that it runs any command you provide it with and it returns the stdout in a weird way.

here is a link to the stackoverflow answer that explains the run function.
https://stackoverflow.com/a/15515651

then we send the html code to anyone who visits the web root.
and then we tell the run command to run "fortune" and send the output to the browser.
so anyone who visits /fortune will get the output of the fortune command.

Good luck modifying!
